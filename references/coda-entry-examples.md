# Example Coda Doc Entries

These are entries for the Self-Serve Growth Weekly Check-In Coda doc table. Each PM adds 1-2 of the most significant/broadly interesting updates per week.

---

## Example 1: Highlight (Launch)

**Generative AI-created YouTube ads are ready for testing.** The goal is to validate whether increased creative diversity from GenAI drives lower CAC.

What's next: If we see a decrease in CAC, we'll make the workflow self-serve for Marketing; if not, we'll iterate on output quality.

---

## Example 2: Highlight (Milestone)

**LTV 2.0 rollout for paid search completes today.** The rollout started last week and will finish today, bringing ~50% of total paid acq spend onto LTV 2.0 bidding. We expect this to drive a 5-10% increase in LTV per $ spent.

What's next: Measure impact post-migration in Jan. Expand LTV 2.0 bidding to the rest of paid acquisition in early Q1.

---

## Example 3: Highlight (Results)

**Google One Tap on paid landing pages increased LTV by ~14%** driven by reduced signup friction, with gains in auths (+150k / yr) and NAUs (+30k / yr).

---

## Example 4: Highlight (Migration + Test)

**LTV 2.0 migration to paid search is complete.** Google Search and Microsoft Search are fully on LTV 2.0. An A/B test on 10% of spend is measuring impact, with results expected mid-February.

What's next: Monitor test through Feb 11, then analyze results. Team is now shifting focus to enable LTV 2.0 for non-search channels (the other 50% of Grammarly marketing spend), targeting early/mid Q1.
