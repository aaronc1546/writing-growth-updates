## Example (LTV 2.0 Non-Search, W04)

:memo: <https://grammarly.atlassian.net/browse/EPDP-2513|Weekly update>
:large_green_circle: **On track.** Web identifiers ready Jan 20, ahead of schedule. Starting sync configuration with Meta and adding identifiers to existing Google syncs to increase match rate. Mobile identifiers still targeting Feb 3.

This week I'll work with Antonio (Meta) and Mike (Google) to configure syncs. DE will report on identifier coverage to inform whether we need Hightouch Match Booster. Mobile channels remain on track for Feb 3; the one gap is App Instance ID, which requires a low-lift ticket to the mobile team.
