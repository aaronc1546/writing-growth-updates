# LTV 2.0 Non-Search Channels - Weekly Update W03

## TL;DR
PRD technical requirements complete from Product side; awaiting DE technical scope on implementation. Mobile identifier availability is a blocker - IDFA, GAID, and other mobile IDs are not currently logged and require net-new pipelines from mobile/growth engineering. Web identifiers exist in our pipeline and can be modeled; targeting end of January for Crawl phase on web channels.

## Highlights
- **PRD technical requirements finalized (Product)**: Completed scoping of P0/P1/P2 identifiers and platform-specific formatting requirements. Awaiting DE technical scope on how to model and surface these identifiers to Hightouch.
- **R&R document aligned with team**: Clarifies ownership across Product, DE, DS, and Marketing for the non-search expansion. Final round of discussion today.
- **Mobile identifiers discovered unavailable**: IDFA, GAID, Adjust Device ID, and other mobile IDs are not logged in current pipelines. Mobile/growth engineering teams are aware but this requires net-new work outside our team's control.

## What Next
- **Finalize R&R today** with one remaining discussion
- **DE delivers technical scope** for modeling web identifiers and surfacing to Hightouch - George and Prahlad reviewing this week
- **Backlog grooming and sprint planning** for identifier implementation once technical scope is complete
- **DE coordinating with mobile/growth teams** on timeline for mobile identifier logging - this will determine when we can enable LTV 2.0 for mobile channels (Adjust, Firebase, UAC)
